- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hsumi0ng from TW.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Digital IC design and Computer Architecture.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently attending Texas A&M as a graduate student.
- I have a relatively complete experience on developing a CIM or In-memory-computing chip project. 
- I worked as an IC design intern in my undergraduate ASIC research center @SEU_CN, building circuits with Hspice and Cadence virtuoso.
- Besides learning hard, Iâ€™m also looking to find an IC design Internship/Job.
